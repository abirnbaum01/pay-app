    <h1>Hello!</a></h1>
    <p>
      <b>This is PayMonkey, your friendly neighborhood loan shark :)</b><br/>
    </p>
    <p>
      You owe some money to <a name="text_email"><%= loaner_email %></a>, who wants to be paid back.  Specifically, you owe

      <% if mailer_type == 'single_payment' %>
        <%= " $" + payment_amount %> for <%= payment_description %>
      <% else %>
        :<br/><ul>
          <% @all_payments.each do |indv_payment| %>
            <li>$<%= indv_payment.amount %> for <%= indv_payment.description %></li>
          <% end %>
        </ul>
      <% end %>

    </p>
    <p>
      We'll send you <%= payment_frequency %> reminders so you don't forget.  Once you have paid back <a name="text_email"><%= loaner_email %></a>, follow <%= link_to 'this link', @url %> to confirm and stop receiving these reminders.<br/>
    </p>
    <p>Thanks and have a great day!</p>
