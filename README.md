# Ruby on Rails Tutorial: PayMonkey

This application helps to track money that other people owe you.  It will automatically email people who owe you money reminders until they pay you back.  Once they pay you back, they can go onto the site and update the  status of their loan to Paid to have the email reminders shut off.



I use mailcatcher, which is not in my gemfile per install instructions:  https://github.com/sj26/mailcatcher
